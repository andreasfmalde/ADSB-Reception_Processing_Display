# ADSB-Reception_Processing_Display_Analysis
ADS-B - Reception, Processing, Display and Analysis. A bachelor thesis by Andreas Follvaag Malde and Fredrik Sundt-Hansen at NTNU Gj√∏vik.

This repository contains the application developed for our bachelor's thesis in Computer Science at the 
Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The purpose of this project was to build an application for 
Electronic Chart Centre AS, so they could use it in their applications. 

The project is a fullstack application able to receive and process live ADS-B flight traffic in SBS format from a 
given source, expose that data through a REST API, and show live and historic data on a website. Golang is used for 
the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and React is used for the frontend.

The application is deployed on the following urls:<br>
`http://129.241.150.147/` - website<br>
`http://129.241.150.147:8080/` - RESTful API

### Installation and deployment
#### Requirements for production environment
- Docker 

#### Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/andreasfmalde/ADSB-Reception_Processing_Display_Analysis.git`
2. `cd .\ADSB-Reception_Processing_Display_Analysis\`
3. Create .env in the project root folder with the following environment variables:  
   - DB_USER
   - DB_PASSWORD 
   - SBS_SOURCE
     <br> Other environment variables are optional and have default values.
  
- Create .env file in frontend folder with the following environment variable: 
  - REACT_APP_SERVER=http://{PUBLIC_IP/localhost}:8080 
    - `Public IP` to the backend API for global access
    - `localhost` for local development where backend and frontend are running on the same computer

    
4. `docker compose up -d`
5. The application should now be running. 

### Requirements for local development
1. Postgres 16.2
2. Golang 1.20 and up
3. NodeJS v16.17 and up


## SBS Receiving API
`backend/cmd/reception/main.go` Consists of an infinite loop that processes SBS data by receiving data through a TCP 
stream and converts the data to aircraft structs. The data is then inserted into a database. A cleanup job using golang's crontab package runs in a seperate thread to delete old data from the database. Preventing it from getting too big.

When processing the SBS data the program assumes that there is a time-period between each batch of new data, this is 
the WaitingTime variable. 

When processing SBS data there are three outcomes:
1. There is an error connecting to the source. It will then log the error, sleep WaitingTime seconds, and retry. 
2. It successfully connected to the source but received no data. That is, it got no data in the time between a
WaitingTime period. It sleeps and retires. 
3. It successfully connected to the source and received data. It will then continue on adding this data to the database.
At the end it will sleep UpdatingPeriod seconds and do another iteration. 

### Why an infinite loop?
There is no end condition to the SBS stream we used for developing and testing, `data.adsbhub.org:5002`. 
The source is a continuous stream, and the application was developed with this in mind.
One could change the loop to exit if there is an error connecting the source. However, if there is downtime on their side, the whole application would end and one would need to restart it. Thus, we decided to have an infinite loop. 

## Database
The current database schema does not use any referential integrity constraints, but uses application enforced 
referential integrity. Due to the fact that the relationship between these two tables is 0..1 to 0..*. Since 
aircraft_current only contains the aircrafts that are in the air at this current time, new aircrafts will not 
have any history yet. On the other hand, aircraft_history might not have any matching aircraft in aircraft_current. 
Due to lack of coverage, aircraft might disappear momentarily and come back again. 

The application enforced referential integrity is handled in `/backend/internal/db/database.go` 

## REST API
`backend/cmd/rest/main.go` To make the retrieved data available for external resources, such as the website described 
below, a RESTful API has been implemented. 

Endpoints:
````text
/aircraft/current/                                                                                                         
/aircraft/history/
````

### Current Aircraft
This endpoint retrieves all aircrafts in aircraft_current table. That is, all aircrafts currently in the air. 

```
Method: GET
Path: /aircraft/current/
Content-Type: application/json 
```

Status code:
```
200: OK
204: No Content. Valid request, but the aircraft with that ICAO does not exists in the database.
400: Bad Request. Not a valid URL, ICAO or hour parameter.
405: Method not allowed. 
414: Request URI too long.
500: Internal Server Error. Returned if the service is unable to respond to the request, and there is something 
wrong with the service.

## Logging
For logging, the 'zerolog' library was used `github.com/rs/zerolog`. The global logging level is set by the environment
variable 'ENV.' For production environment: ENV=production, sets the global logging level to Warning, e.i., all logs with 
Warning, Error, Fatal, Panic will be logged. Any other value than 'prod' or 'production' will set the global logging 
level to trace, all levels are logged, Trace, Debug, Info, Warning etc.  

## Website
The frontend part of this project is built with ReactJS. It is a single-page web application that displays aircrafts in the air on a map to the user. The website is updated every 30 seconds by making a new request to the current endpoint of the backend API to show the most recent data. Selecting an aircraft will make properties like altitude, speed, track and position data available to the user. This will also fire two more API calls. One call to the histroy endpoint of the backend API. This data is used by the frontend to show history trails behind the aircraft. The other call is to an external API `https://www.planespotters.net/photo/api` that will provide a photo of the selected aircraft.

Another feature of the website is the ability to search for a specific aircraft by its ICAO code or callsign. This will make the map 'fly to' the aircraft and show its properties.

### Fronted dependencies
In additon to the use of ReactJS, there are other dependencies used to make the website work. These are:
#### Maplibre GL JS
MapLibre GL JS is a JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render interactive maps from vector tiles and Mapbox styles. It is a fork of Mapbox GL JS which is no longer open source. MapLibre GL JS is used to display the map on the website, together with markers for the aircrafts, the history trails and the 'fly to' feature.
#### React Map GL
React Map GL is a React wrapper for MapLibre GL JS. It is used to make it easier to use MapLibre GL JS in a React project. This includes the use of components like Map, Marker, Source and Layer, which all have the form of React components.
#### OpenStreetMap
OpenStreetMap is used to provide the map tiles rendered on the map. It is a free and open-source map that can be used by anyone. MapLibre GL JS uses OpenStreetMap as a source for the map tiles.

### Local frontend deployment
The frontend web application can be deployed locally by using the following steps:
1. NodeJS must be installed on the local machine. 
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the frontend directory in the repository.
4. Run the command `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
5. Create a file named `.env` in the frontend directory. Add the following line to the file: `REACT_APP_SERVER=<BACKEND API URL>`. REACT_APP_SERVER is the URL of the backend API that the frontend will use to fetch current and histroy data.
6. Run the command `npm start` to start the development server.

## Deployment 
For deploying the service, Docker is used. The Docker Compose file in the root of the project orchestrates deploying 
backend with frontend. However, if one would like to only deploy the frontend, there is a compose file in the frontend 
directory. As described above, `REACT_APP_SERVER` can be set to a remote URL hosting the backend. 

There exist three Dockerfiles. Two for backend, one for each main in cmd directory, and one for frontend. This way there
is a clear separation of the different services the application provides, making logging and maintainability easier. 

Additionally, in the project root folder, there is a .env file for setting environment variables. These are variables
 the backend uses for connecting to the database, set global values like WaitingTime, CleaningPeriod, etc. 
For developing, default values are set in `backend/internal/global/db.go` for database variables, and 
`backend/internal/global/sbs.go` for SBS variables. An instance of the environment variable in the .env file will 
overwrite the default values. 

Environment variables:
- DB_USER, database username, No default value
- DB_PASSWORD, database password, No default value
- DB_NAME, database name, Default value: adsb_db
- DB_HOST, database host, Default value: localhost
- DB_PORT, database port, Default Value: 5432
- WAITING_TIME, time between each batch of SBS data, Default value: 4 seconds
- CLEANING_SCHEDULE, crontab schedule for cleaning old data, Default value is once a day: 0 0 * * *
- UPDATING_PERIOD, time between next for-loop iteration, Default value: 10 seconds
- MAX_DAYS_HISTORY, max amount of history to keep in the database, Default value: 1 day
- SBS_SOURCE, URL for the SBS source to be used for retrieving flight data, No default value

## Testing
Throughout the project, a combination of unit testing and integration testing is used. For testing individual database
functions, a system of setup and teardown is used. The function `setupTestDB(t *testing.T) *Context` will create all
necessary tables for testing, regardless if the tables are going to be used or not. Then a defer statement is used for
the function `teardownTestDB(ctx *Context, t *testing.T)`. This will drop all tables and close the connection. 
This is done with all database tests, making them more integration tests than unit tests-. This was implemented instead
of using database mocks.

All other parts of the application utilize unit tests. Tests that require database interactions make use of a mock
database through the 'gomock' library at 'github.com/golang/mock/gomock'.


For GeoJSON testing, the comprehensive GeoJSON schema available at https://geojson.org/schema/GeoJSON.json is utilized.

Frontend testing is done with the Jest testing framework and testing-library/react. The tests are located in the `frontend/src/__tests__` directory. To run the tests, navigate to the frontend directory and run the command `npm test`.
